## Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per Country (EBU)

GDP is the monetary value of all finished goods and services made within a country during a specific period. GDP provides an economic snapshot of a country, used to estimate the size of an economy and growth rate. 

This is an experimental template for showing the GDP growth percent per country from 1961 to 2017. The economic crisis in 2008 and 2009 can be seen quite clearly.
